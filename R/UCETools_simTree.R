#' UCETools simulation tree
#'
#' @description ## `UCETools_simTree`
#' An [ape] phylo object containing the phylogeneitc tree on which the 800 example UCE alignments
#' included in this package were simulated. The alignments can be accessed via the file path returned by:
#' ```system.file("extdata", "UCE_aligns", package = "UCETools")```. The trees associated with these
#' alignments are can be accessed via the file path returned by: ```system.file("extdata", "UCE_aligns_genetrees", package = "UCETools")```.
#' The genetrees were infered using a simple maximum likelihood search using IQTREE.
